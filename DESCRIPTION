Description:  This package provides a suite of tools for integrated Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and network visualization. 
    It includes functions for combining high-throughput sequencing datasets, performing community detection using Louvain algorithms,
    calculating various centrality measures within communities, and generating customized network plots with ggraph. The package
    leverages known gene functions to overcome sparsity in overlapping gene signatures, thereby facilitating drug mechanism studies 
    and other bioinformatics applications.
